To say it is a superior sequel would be unfair, for Ryan Coogler essentially had to make a whole new movie to honor his late star and friend. You will see a great deal of scenes from the previous film re-enacted as well as making callbacks to other MCU films. But that is just the tip of the iceberg!" </i> </mark> <br> <img src="stars.png" alt="rating" width="150" height="150"> </td>
